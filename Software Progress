Quadrant 2:
  First measure line from image from camera by going through pixels in middle line
  Find the max white value and min white value to determine the threshold between white and black
  Use this to find where the black line is and calculate error
  Adjust motor speeds to turn depending on the error value (turn right or left, how far left etc.)
  Unless line has dissapeared, then go backwards and repeat
  Update motor speed and hardware
